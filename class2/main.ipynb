    "## Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Do I need to re-install rails every time I switch my ruby version?\n",
    "A: Yes, we need to reinstall all our gems every time we switch ruby versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Should I experiment with ruby/rails priview versions?\n",
    "A: At first, probably not: they could completely break an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can we use `rails generate`?\n",
    "A: At first, we are only allowed to use two generators: `model` and `migration`.\n",
    "We should only ever use generators if we know exactly what is being generated.\n",
    "Otherwise we might be introducing bugs and security vulnerabilities without even\n",
    "realising it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Should we use Test Driven Deveolpment for everything?\n",
    "A: Yes, ideally; we should never try to solve the feature all at once. We should\n",
    "write the test describing the feature and get it to pass incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Do we need any other gems/dependencies?\n",
    "A: We won't need any other other gems unless explicitly told otherwise.\n",
